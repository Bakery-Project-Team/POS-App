The Point-of-Sale (POS) application revolutionizes spontaneous sales to walk-up customers during delivery runs. It allows drivers to load items via invoice, add them to a cart, calculate change, print bills, and manage inventory updates in real time. The system reduces inefficiencies and ensures seamless handling of on-the-spot transactions.

Powered by Ionic, Angular, and SQLite, the POS application is designed for simplicity and efficiency, functioning offline to accommodate the lack of Wi-Fi access during operations. The interface is tailored for use with the provided POS terminal hardware, ensuring smooth integration.
